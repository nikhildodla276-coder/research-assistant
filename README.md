# AI Research Assistant

A full-stack AI-powered research tool built with FastAPI and LangChain. Given a topic, it searches the web in real time, generates a structured research report using an LLM, supports follow-up conversation with memory, and sends a Discord notification on research completion.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | FastAPI, Python 3.13 |
| LLM | Groq API — `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| Web Search | Tavily Search (`langchain_tavily`) |
| Memory | `InMemoryChatMessageHistory`, `RunnableWithMessageHistory` |
| HTTP Client | httpx (async) |
| Notifications | Discord Webhook |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, marked.js |
| Environment | python-dotenv |

## Features

- **Real-time web research** — Tavily searches the web and feeds results to the LLM
- **Structured report generation** — LLM produces a clean, markdown-formatted research report
- **Persistent conversation memory** — Follow-up questions maintain context per session using `InMemoryChatMessageHistory`
- **Session isolation** — Each browser session gets a unique `session_id` generated via `Date.now()`
- **Markdown rendering** — Reports and chat responses rendered via `marked.js`
- **Discord notifications** — Captain Hook webhook posts topic and session ID to `#general` on research completion
- **Dark theme frontend** — Three-file frontend with research panel and persistent chat panel

## API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Health check — returns `{"status": "ok"}` |
| POST | `/research` | Accepts `topic` and `session_id`, returns research report |
| POST | `/chat` | Accepts `message` and `session_id`, returns LLM response with memory |

### Request Models

**ResearchRequest**
```json
{
  "topic": "quantum computing",
  "session_id": "1234567890"
}
```

**ChatRequest**
```json
{
  "message": "Explain the key findings in simpler terms",
  "session_id": "1234567890"
}
```

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13
- Groq API key — [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
- Tavily API key — [tavily.com](https://tavily.com)
- Discord server with a webhook URL

### Steps

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikhildodla276-coder/research-assistant.git
cd research-assistant
```

**2. Create and activate virtual environment**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_discord_webhook_url
```

**5. Run the server**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**6. Open the frontend**

Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1 — FastAPI Foundation
Established the FastAPI project structure with a health check endpoint (`GET /health`) and a research route (`POST /research`). Added Pydantic request validation with `ResearchRequest` model. Verified via Swagger UI at `/docs`.

### Phase 2 — LangChain Research Pipeline
Built `researcher.py` with `run_research` function integrating `ChatGroq` (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) and `TavilySearch` (max 5 results). The function fetches live web results, builds a structured prompt, and returns an LLM-generated report.

### Phase 3 — Conversation Memory
Implemented `InMemoryChatMessageHistory` with `RunnableWithMessageHistory` for per-session memory. Added `run_chat` function for follow-up questions that skip Tavily and query the LLM directly with full conversation history. Memory is stored in a `store` dict keyed by `session_id`.

### Phase 4 — Frontend
Built a three-file dark-theme frontend (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`). Features a research panel for report display and a persistent chat panel for follow-up conversation. Markdown rendering via `marked.js`. Unique `session_id` generated per page load using `Date.now()`. Added `CORSMiddleware` to `main.py`.

### Phase 5 — Discord Webhook Notifications
Created `discord_notifier.py` with an async `notify_discord(topic, session_id)` function using `httpx.AsyncClient`. After every successful research completion, a formatted notification is POSTed to a Discord channel via webhook. Integrated into the `/research` route in `main.py`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |

| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq API key for LLM access |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Tavily API key for web search |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord channel webhook URL for notifications |

currently working on building a concrete plan on how to modify my present working research assistant project to a real world useful tool which helps my production more siginificantly by replacing all the boring tasks to be done by AI.

## What We Are Building — Final Confirmed Plan

**Project:** Personal Research Assistant — upgraded from Project 4.

**Two modes:**
Research mode — you ask, it fetches from trusted sources, answers with full attribution, you ask follow-ups grounded in fetched content.
Daily Brief mode — runs automatically, monitors sources, sends digest to Discord.

**Sources:**
Hacker News API, Official documentation via direct fetching, Wellfound via Tavily domain filter, GitHub via Tavily domain filter.

**LLM Pipeline:**
Two stages — small fast model for filtering, stronger model for analysis and explanation.

**Non-negotiables:**
Every response shows source URL, author, date, exact excerpt. LangSmith tracing on every LLM call. Failure handling for every external service. Caching to avoid redundant fetches. Your profile as permanent context in every query.

**Frontend:**
Two mode toggle, one search bar, results as attributed cards, chat panel grounded in fetched content.

- Build query params dict and encode full Algolia search URL
- Add httpx GET request with raise_for_status()
- Handle ConnectError, TimeoutException, and HTTPStatusError
  with structured error dicts

fetch_hn is not yet complete: response parsing and the
extraction loop (8-field clean dicts from raw hits) are
still pending.
